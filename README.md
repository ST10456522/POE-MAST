In Mast5112 part 3 i have change few things from part 2. In part 3 there are 3 screen namely the home screen, chef screen and filter screen. I was required to make those screens so that in home screen the user can
see all menu items and the average price per course and the menu should specify the name of each  dish, price, description and course. The chef screen has a text input where the chef can add new item, clear
info and remove the specific item. Filter screen filters the menu items per course based on what the user may want like show main oly then it displays only the main courses. i also added the Tap navigation 
at the bottom of the screens so that it gets easy for user to go from screen to screen.i used an array to calculate the average price for each course.
